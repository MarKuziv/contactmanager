Contact Manager

It's a complete end-to-end application with Spring 3.0 MVC as front end technology and Hibernate as backend ORM technology. For this application I will also use Maven for build and dependency management and MySQL as database to persist the data.
The application will be a simple Contact Manager app which will allow user to add new contacts. 
The list of contacts will be displayed and user will be able to delete existing contacts.
